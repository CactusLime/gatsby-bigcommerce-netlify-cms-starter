### WHY SYZYGY HELLO

Scissors. Gee whiz. Energy. Now that you’ve practiced your articulation exercises, you can try saying our name: SYZYGY \[SIZZ–UH–JEE]. SYZYGY is the alignment of three celestial bodies; traditionally, sun, earth, and moon. Here, it’s also the alignment of your mind, body, and world. When all three are aligned, we become the best and most present versions of ourselves.

### WHO IS SYZYGY

With an emphasis on science, a disregard for cost-cutting ingredients, and one belief: that anyone who tries our SYZYGY CBD will notice a difference and embrace their newfound quality of life. From anxiety experienced on flights to sore joints after a fifth triathlon, we’re here for all of it. Our SYZYGY products are made according to your body – and the benefits are consistent. With none of the bad, you can focus on the good: your alignment, productivity, mindfulness, and presence in the moment. Welcome to the best version of yourself, and our version of a better world.

LIVE SYZYGY. LIVE ALIGNED.

### Retail is our therapy

Taking the scenic route through a city and figuring out what resonates with us is one of our favorite activies. Curation equals relaxation for us.

### We started a while ago

Our first retail shop was up and running almost 30 years ago!
