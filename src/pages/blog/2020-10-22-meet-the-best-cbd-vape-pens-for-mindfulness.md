There’s an old Spanish proverb that states, *“Tell me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you who you are.”* We believe the same to be true when it comes to brands and CBD Vape Pens. **Who you support, says something about you and what you believe in.** 

 

We believe in bringing out the best in people and creating an environment where anyone can strengthen their ideas and creative visions. **Our products serve as a liaison between individuals and connection with mind, body, and world.** 

 

Since the beginning of SYZYGY, we haven’t taken that quote lightly and have been connecting with so many like minded people who also love exploring the world and creating. We’ve recently created a new squad with CBD as well, and we’d love for you to join in!

 

Before **introducing our two CBD vape pen friends,** knowing that you don’t just join any new clan, let us properly tell you where we come from and who we are.

 

### We are SYZYGY \[SIZZ-UH-JEE]!

 

 We aren’t just a cool name that is crisp and fresh like your minty chewing gum; we walk the talk too. SYZYGY is defined in the dictionary as*[ ‘the alignment of three celestial bodies, traditionally, sun, earth, and moon.’](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/syzygy)* ** As lovers of the universal space,** we’ve taken that idea into our CBD vape pens and SYZYGY lifestyle. 

 

We believe that **while we’ve all come from different places, with different stories, that a lot of us are rooted in the same values and ideas.** 

 

Just like you, we want the real deal when it comes to CBD and everything else that we choose to consume and align with. **When high-class inhales take place with our SYZYGY CBD vape pens, a clearer mind can communicate better with the body as it travels freely in the world.**



### What Makes SYZYGY Stand Out?

 

Now that you know what SYZYGY means, let us tell you about some of our personality traits. If we are going to be friends, you have to know what makes us glow. 

 

We are not your average Joe, in other words, not just another CBD vape pen company. **The SYZYGY Brand is a model of our lifestyle, values, and intentions.**

 

To remain in alignment with that lifestyle, our Colorado, non-GMO, sun grown hemp is hand farmed to organic standards and state certified by the Department of Agriculture. We act intentionally to **ensure the highest level of purity and quality** with product transparency to help you feel your best.

 

SYZYGY is crafted using broad spectrum, whole plant extracts at our state-of-the-art partner facilities. We also use closed and cold processes to preserve the naturally occurring cannabinoid terpenes for maximum benefits in both of our **organically grown CBD vape pens**. All traces of THC are removed to 0.0%. 



### Alright, it’s time to meet your two new friends: the Refresh and Unwind CBD Vape Pens. 

 

Guided by the science-backed wisdom of CBD, our proprietary plant based blends are formulated by chemists to help *s***hift your mindset, enhance your sleep, assist in relieving your pain, and support whole self wellness.** Broad Spectrum hemp can be a great addition to help **strengthen your immune system**, improve **circulatory function**, and **encourages homeostasis** (to maintain a stable, relatively constant internal environment) throughout your entire body.

 

**We never use** Parabens, Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), Vegetable Glycerin (VG), Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCT has been shown to not be safe when heated), Synthetic Fragrances, Vitamin E Acetate, or any other toxic ingredients found in most other CBD vape pens. **We believe that plants are the best medicine,** especially when it comes to vaped CBD.

 

All botanical ingredients in our pens are **crafted to increase the full potential of the plant’s power.** From the bioavailability of our Broad Spectrum CBD, to carefully preserving its therapeutic properties, and extensive third party lab testing – we are committed to providing you with the best of the best when it comes to your SYZYGY plant based CBD vaporizer.
